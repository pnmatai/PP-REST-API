First step is to get PayPal REST API credentials. Below are the steps:
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/ . Either create a new PP live account or login with your existing live account. 
2. Once logged in, click on the "Dashboard" tab at the top right hand side corner
3. Under Sandbox--> Accounts, you will already see a Sandbox busineses account created for you by default. If you wish, you can also create a new sandbox business and personal accounts for testing.
4. Uner Dashboard--> My Apps & Credentials --> REST API apps --> Create App
Enter an App name and select the sandbox email address you wish to associate with the REST App. Click "Create App"

This will give you the Sandbox API credentials for REST API testing. These credentials would be your
- Sandbox account email address
- Client ID 
- Secret
